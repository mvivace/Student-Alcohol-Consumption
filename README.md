# Student-Alcohol-Consumption
Evaluating the influence of the alcohol consumption on the possibility to engage in a romantic relationship.

This is a final project for the *Machine Learning* course from my Master in Data Science. 

The consuption of alchool between young people and teenagers is a very worrying phenomenon. It can have complex effects on the behavior of individuals due to activation of inhibitory neurotransmitters and suppression of excitatory ones, combined with an increase in dopamine. This can have serious implications in the health and psycho-social fields, given the ease of association with other risk behaviors, as well as direct effects as loss of coordination, reduction in school performance, aggressiveness, violence, etc. This is why the World Health Organization prohibits the consumption of alcohol under the age of 15. 

In this project we use different Machine Learning tools to analyse the influence of the alchool assumption and other factors on the possibility to engage in a romantic relationship. We've used several **Classification Models** (Heuristic model, regression models) to predict the target variable: Romantic relationship. Firstly we used the variables: "Daily alchol consumption" and "Weekly alchol consumption" as explanatory variables, secondly because these variables were not appropriate to explicate the propension of the students to engage romantic relationship we use the **Feature Selection** to identify the variables that result significant to explicate the target variable. To evaluate the performance of the classification models we've used different measures as Precision, Accuracy, Recall, AUC (Area Under Curve) and the ROC curve that can be seen in the following graph.
